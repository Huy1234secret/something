# Maxwell Bot

This project is a Discord bot for managing various server functions.

## Setup

Run the installation script which automatically installs all required dependencies:

```bash
sudo bash install_deps.sh
```

This script ensures Node.js (v16 or higher) and Python 3 are present, creates the `python` symlink needed for `yt-dlp-exec`, and installs the Node.js packages with `npm install`.

Start the bot with:

```bash
node index.js
```
